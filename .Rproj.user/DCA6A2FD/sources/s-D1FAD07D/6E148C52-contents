##Introduction

A popular source of argument among friends, enemies, frenemies, and family members (which could be in any of the previous categories) is the state of gun ownership and gun violence in the United States today. I know I have (cordially of course) discussed this issue a fair bit, especially after the Vegas and Parkland shootings. A common train of disagreement that tends to come from these conversations is the issue of regulation. Some people associated with a particular political leaning argue that more regulation leads to fewer guns which leads to less gun violence. Other people with the opposite political inclination argue that the regulations would only be followed by people who wouldn't be committing gun crimes anyway, and the regulations would just give wrongdoers more incentive to do wrong without the fear of an armed bystander. However, rather than presenting unbiased information to the public, news sources have decided to join one side of the argument or the other to make more money. On the regulation-is-good side of the argument (henceforth referred to as pro-regulation), there is [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/the-states-with-the-most-gun-laws-see-the-fewest-gun-related-deaths/448044/) and [this more scholarly article from Stanford](https://news.stanford.edu/2017/12/07/new-study-analyzes-recent-gun-violence-research/). On the other, regulation-is-bad side of the argument (henceforth the anti-regulation stance) is [this article](http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/03/28/chicago-murder-rate-sky-high-despite-strict-gun-control-laws). Because, as mentioned before, news is sensationalist and we can't believe anything they say, we will do the data ourselves. We will be getting our information on gun crime from [this Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data) and cross referencing it with [this data set on gun laws](https://www.statefirearmlaws.org/table.html). We will play with weights based on issues that matter to us using [this supporting table](https://www.statefirearmlaws.org/glossary.html). After we store this data in R and make it pretty and clean, we will visualize it with multiple charts, perform some regression work, and even use ML to predict future gun violence rates. Of course, I don't know where this data came from exactly, it could come from people who are as bad as the news sources. Also, we must understand that there are several factors at work in an issue like this one, and just because a correlation was found doesn't mean there is causation. 

As a final thought, I wrote the preceeding without doing any data analysis, so I will be just as suprised by the results of these proceidures when I finish running them as you will be when you read this for the first time!

## Data Curation

Found some stuff



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
